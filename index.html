                Dreams dominate the human experience; They let us escape beyond the daily hustle, with its regrets and bitterness, to something sweeter — something too good to be true. They are more precious than reality: they satisfy the cravings that aren't fulfilled, replacing them with hope.

                The American Dream is the joint dream of success. It creates an unhealthy aspiration to become someone that is unlikely for the common American. We seek to provide a solution to this disparity between dreams and achievable goals.

                    Is it not obvious that a state may at length attain such a degree of unity as to be no longer a state? Since the nature of a state is to be a plurality, and in tending to greater unity, from being a state, it becomes a family, and from being a family, an individual.

            <p>
                A dream is an aspiration, a wish. It should be unique to each person's desires in their life. In part two of Book Two of Aristotle's "Politics," Aristotle discusses the degree of unity of the people within a state. He states, "[T]he nature of a state is to be a plurality, and in tending to greater unity, from being a state, it becomes a family, and from being a family, an individual." The critical part of a dream is that unique connection to its holder. This connection gives dreams power over their holder: most people will do anything to make their dreams come true.<br>
                <br>
                On the contrary, losing a dream can destroy its holder, like what happens to Walter in "A Raisin in the Sun." Even though dreams should be unique, the American Dream attempts to form a united dream. It places a uniform wish in the heads of the American, even if they were never meant to seek that dream.

                    The Homestead Act allowed every adult in the US to move and claim 160 acres of land. This act gave many people hope in alleviating poverty. However, it "proved to be no panacea for poverty" because many people could not even "afford to build a farm or acquire the necessary tools, seed, and livestock" (archives.gov). The conditions of living in the midwest, where many homesteaders moved, were terrible. The midwest has terrible tornados and dust storms that would destroy the homes or even kill the people in their wake. Furthermore, Anything the homesteaders could build was shoddily built, like the hut on the bottom. The inability to achieve their dreams of living peacefully on a farm left many homesteaders disheartened or even dead.

            <p id="section2-redlining"> <!-- How long has this issue existed in America ex 2 -->
                The Great Depression was caused by everyone chasing the American Dream at once. Everyone desperately scrambled to the top of the capitalist machine via the Stock market, and it inevitably crashed. The Great Depression was the antithesis of the preceding years, known as the gilded age. During the Great Depression, there was rampant homelessness, and Bank failure meant many people lost their life savings. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's solution to this homelessness started the process of redlining through the National Housing Act of 1934. In "Homelessness and Black History: Access to Housing," the NAEH notes that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) made through Residential Security Maps. Green areas meant the best area, where the "best" people (businessmen) lived; blue areas meant "good" (white-collar workers) people, while red meant "hazardous" areas, where primarily foreign immigrants, low-class whites, and people of color lived. Redlining made it challenging for residents to buy or refinance a house, receive public service of any kind, or own houses of significant property value. In the NAEH's words, "The federal government began implementing new programs designed to make housing more accessible … these programs … excluded Black Americans" (NAEH). The structure of the quote highlights just how sinister this form of discrimination was. The author describes the program in the way the government would: a beneficial program for all. The immediate switch-up reflects the double-sidedness of these programs and how the US government sneakily used the program to undermine Black wealth accumulation. Merrefield explains this further, stating, "black families faced dual barriers to wealth accumulation: they paid more in rent for similar housing while the homes they were able to purchase rapidly declined in value" (Merrefield). The government weaponized the Great Depression to gate-keep the "American Dream" from Black people by only serving the portion of Americans it deemed “worthy." These issues persist in "A Raisin in the Sun" because redlining put Black families like the Youngers in positions where they have to fight for their dreams against government institutions that hold them back, where the systemic issues and inequalities that factored into the American Dream were not even their fault. The Youngers being able to buy a house was an exception, one that was met with hostility from their white neighbors.

                Throughout his timeless classic, "The Great Gatsby," F. Scott Fitzgerald explores the fundamental questions of time, memories, and dreams in the setting that was regarded as the “Roaring Twenties,” but also known as the Gilded Age. It was a time marked by lavishness, prosperity, and leisure in American society, but yet with underlying ugly truths that any extravagant wardrobe or makeup can't hide. It was a time with declining morality, rampant racism, consumerism, and widening gaps between the rich and the poor, where both dreamed of pursuing something. The fatal flaw of the main character, Jay Gatsby, was his dream of constructing a perfect future through a more benevolent recreation of a regretful past, which included reuniting with Daisy and their love for each other to “fix everything.” However, we cannot control time. Any attempt to recreate the past is an unworthy pursuit, as it's metaphorically compared to beating boats against a current at the end of the book, where no matter how hard we try, we would always set back. What is the current? There's the current, the current of time, the current of fate, the current of our “place” in society accompanied by our little wooden oars of grasping ego and money and pride. We will not go anywhere with our current interpretations of the American Dream. It's our power, it's our curse, including the endless pursuit of those who were less wealthy than Gatsby. In hopes of the American Dream, people from all over the world flock to America for a more promising future, a future full of opportunities, wealth, and freedom. But, do they get it? Could we say that they achieved their dreams when most go on living in urban tenements with gruesome factory jobs? Could we say that they achieved their dreams, when looking, they can see their future stretched out in front, just plain as day. A big, looming blank space full of nothing, hanging at the edge of their days, working tirelessly from dawn to dusk. Meanwhile, at a glance, Gatsby is the American dream: wealthy, powerful, and living an extravagant lifestyle. His endless parties and lavish wardrobes are the dreams of many. But did he achieve his dreams? Fitzgerald gave us his answer: Gatsby was shot dead by Wilson, who died with the hope that Daisy would return to him while on the same day, Daisy fled with her husband, Tom Buchanan. Gatsby's dream was broken. Ultimately, Fitzgerald poses a critical question for us: How are we any different from Gatsby? How are we different from anyone else who struggled with the American Dream of success, desires, and utopia? Moreover, in a society where everyone only had one common dream, one common pursuit, how would we ever be free from our desires? How can we ever free ourselves from the encouraged conformist thinking of society? How would we ever know what we want and understand who we really are? Speaking of this, is the American Dream a worthy pursuit? No, there isn't one uniform utopia that fits all. Gatsby attained the corruptible American Dream, but yet he lost his dream in search of the meaning of his life.

                Covid-19 was started because of the mingling of humans and animals. As the human population continues to grow and more people pursue the American Dream through lust for more, we risk expanding into animal populations and contracting more Zoonotic diseases. Eirini Katti notes that “highly globalized supply chains…[and] Growth-led demand for natural resources leads to the transmission of deadly viruses to humans” (Eirini Katti). The connotation of demand is harsh and unyielding, which emphasizes the American Dream's negative impact on contemporary society. There is currently a harsh and unyielding demand on the environment to procure the tools necessary for those at the top to generate wealth. The entire planet is geared towards racing toward the American Dream of wealth --- putting entire ecosystems at risk of invasion to make room for capitalist infrastructure.

            <p id="section3-social-media">
                Social media is the amalgamation of people's goals and wishes. For every person who has achieved something, another person is dreaming of achieving it, and social media allows these two people to easily find each other through its algorithms. Everything one could want, they can instantly find someone else who has. This instant search allows dreams to boil into jealousy, which can harm both the person holding the dream and the one who has achieved that dream. This is similar to how one loses their dream; they see someone else who has done it already, which can cause them to lose hope. <br>
                <br>
                However, not all hope is lost. Seeing someone who has already succeeded can also motivate one to succeed. Social media can work oppositely: connecting the have with the have-not allows the person who succeeded to support the struggling person. Many motivational influencers have this relationship with their audience. By leveraging their past successes, David Goggins, for example, shares how he disciplined himself in order to succeed in becoming a navy seal.

                How do dreams relate to "A Raisin in the Sun?"

        </section>

            "A Raisin in the Sun," a play by Lorraine Hansberry, focuses on the lives of the Younger family, a black family living in the southside of Chicago during the mid-20th century. In the play, Hansberry reveals the dreams of many characters, only to later utterly shatter them. Through the characters' reactions, Hansberry demonstrates the strength dreams have over influencing any individual in society. One of the main characters, Walter, is shown to lose his dream after his trusted friend runs away with their agreed money to open a store (Hansberry 128). Walter is devastated. His dream of opening a liquor store as his means of success and as support for his family is destroyed. The loss is so consuming that Walter stops working entirely. Instead, he drives to scenic locations as an escape.<br>
            <br>
            Additionally, Walter becomes so desperate to reclaim the lost money that he becomes willing to sell what does not belong to him: the home his mother bought &mdash; his mother's dream. Similarly, Beneatha also experiences a feeling of hopelessness upon losing her dream of attending medical school and becoming a doctor. Initially entering a state of denial, she tells herself her original dream of becoming a doctor to help people is neither enough nor attainable anymore. The impact of losing her dream is so profound that she even begins to question the purpose of any action, claiming that "there is only one large circle that [they] march in" (Hansberry 134). She quickly concludes that all actions, whether her own or that of any other individual, are ultimately meaningless.

            <p>
                In the midst of confusion, busyness, and the pursuit of the American Dream, we lost sight of ourselves. The ideal life is often portrayed by culture, in movies, books, shows and media, and such seeps into our everyday lives. But what if we stop to think about if this life is even good for us? What about the people who lived quiet, modest lives in nature, or in search of themselves rather than the dreams of wealth and power? <br>
                <br>
                The transcendentalist proposes a possible solution. They focused much of their philosophy and values on simplicity, self-reliance, authenticity, and separating one's self from conventional modern life. 19th-century philosopher and transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau not only thought this but also lived it. Instead of following the standard, and expected career paths of society, he founded the transcontinental movement and, for most of his life, lived in a cabin in the woods, where he lived a serene life, focusing on what he believed was truly valuable. He worked only one day a week, reduced his material needs to a minimum, and lived away from the outside world. But we don't have to do that because, after all, we all are social animals that are part of society and can't afford to leave it. <br>
                <br>
                We propose you to follow similar practices, but take the time to slow down from the past paces of the big urban city. For example, meditate for a brief amount of time every day, at least 5 minutes. And dedicate a time of the day to reflect on introspection: what is my individual truth? If I had all the time in the world, what would I do? Use this time to seek your own happiness and focus only on the dreams that YOU want to accomplish and fulfill.  Of course, if the American Dream is your true dream, then feel free, but if your dream is not the American Dream, then we should not force it upon ourselves. As we live in the urban world where fast pacing dominates our daily lives, it's important to maintain our own authentic selves. May you find a land of peace and music that truly belongs to you, however measured or far away.

                Dreams dominate the human experience; They let us escape beyond the daily hustle, with its regrets and bitterness, to something sweeter — something too good to be true. They are more precious than reality: they satisfy the cravings that aren't fulfilled, replacing them with hope.

                The American dream forces a uniform goal upon every American. It creates an unhealthy aspiration to become someone that is unlikely for the common American. We seek to provide a solution to this disparity between dreams and achievable goals.

                    The Homestead Act allowed every adult in the US to move and claim 160 acres of land. This act gave many people hope in alleviating poverty. However, it "proved to be no panacea for poverty" because many people couldn't even "afford to build a farm or acquire the necessary tools, seed, and livestock" (archives.gov). The conditions of living in the midwest, where many homesteaders moved, were terrible. The midwest has terrible tornados and dust storms that would destroy the homes or even kill the people in their wake. Furthermore, Anything the homesteaders could build was shoddily built, like the hut on the bottom. The inability to achieve their dreams of living peacefully on a farm left many homesteaders disheartened or even dead.

            <p id="section2-redlining"> <!-- How long has this issue existed in America ex 2 -->
                When everyone chases the American Dream too far, you end up with the Great Depression. Everyone desperately scrambled to the top of the capitalist machine via the Stock market, and it inevitably crashed. The Great Depression was the antithesis of the preceding years, known as the gilded age. During the Great Depression, there was rampant homelessness, and Bank failure meant many people lost their life savings. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's solution to this homelessness started the process of redlining through the National Housing Act of 1934. In "Homelessness and Black History: Access to Housing," the NAEH notes that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) made through Residential Security Maps. Green areas meant the best area, where the "best" people (businessmen) lived; blue areas meant "good" (white-collar workers) people, while red meant "hazardous" areas, where primarily foreign immigrants, low-class whites, and people of color lived. Redlining made it challenging for residents to buy or refinance a house, receive public service of any kind, or own houses of significant property value. In the NAEH's words, "The federal government began implementing new programs designed to make housing more accessible … these programs … excluded Black Americans" (NAEH). The structure of the quote highlights just how sinister this form of discrimination was. The author describes the program in the way the government would: a beneficial program for all. The immediate switch-up reflects the double-sidedness of these programs and how the US government sneakily used the program to undermine Black wealth accumulation. Merrefield explains this further, stating, "black families faced dual barriers to wealth accumulation: they paid more in rent for similar housing while the homes they were able to purchase rapidly declined in value" (Merrefield). The government weaponized the Great Depression to gate-keep the "American Dream" from Black people by only serving the portion of Americans it deemed “worthy." These issues persist in "A Raisin in the Sun" because redlining put Black families like the Youngers in positions where they have to fight for their dreams against government institutions that hold them back, where the systemic issues and inequalities that factored into the American Dream were not even their fault. The Youngers being able to buy a house was an exception, one that was met with hostility from their white neighbors.

                Social media is the amalgamation of people's goals and wishes. For every person who has achieved something, another person is dreaming of achieving it, and social media allows these two people to easily find each other through its algorithms. Everything one could want, they can instantly find someone else who has. This instant search allows dreams to boil into jealousy, which can harm both the person holding the dream and the one who has achieved that dream. This is similar to how one loses their dream; they see someone else who has done it already, which can cause them to lose hope.

                But not all hope is lost. Seeing someone who has already succeeded can also motivate one to succeed. Social media can work oppositely: connecting the have with the have-not allows the person who succeeded to support the struggling person. Many motivational influencers have this relationship with their audience. By leveraging their past successes, David Goggins, for example, shares how he disciplined himself in order to succeed in becoming a navy seal.
